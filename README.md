# Object_Detection

### 🚀 Project Overview  
- 🔍 **Object Detection App** using **YOLOv3**, **OpenCV**, and **Flask**.  
- 🖼️ Users can **upload an image** via a web interface to detect objects in real time.  
- 📦 Outputs include:  
  - Object **name**  
  - 📐 **Bounding box** coordinates  
  - 🎯 **Confidence score**  
  - 🎨 Assigned **color code** for each object  



### 📚 Features  
- 🤖 Pre-trained YOLOv3 model trained on **COCO dataset** (80+ object classes).  
- 🌐 Clean, responsive **HTML/CSS frontend** for easy image upload.  
- 🧠 Uses OpenCV’s **DNN module** for efficient object detection.  
- 💬 JSON response with detection details.  
- ⚙️ Customizable: Swap models, edit class names, tweak threshold.


### 🖼️ How It Works  
- Upload an image 🖼️  
- The server runs YOLOv3 detection 🧠  
- Detected objects are returned with boxes and labels ✏️  
- Result is shown as structured JSON 🧾
